# Audio API

This directory will be used for code relating to the handling of audio files,
e.g parsing them for metadata, transcoding etc. Long way off for now :)
May have to use a C++ node module for performance reasons, especially for
large libraries, so that multicore processors can fully be taken advantage of.

1: Make Media Path relative from Source path not absolute
   (otherwise we're leaking the full directory path to the client not ideal)
   OR, should this even be a queryable field? perhaps the media API should
   just use the song ID
   Revised thoughts:
      1. The path relative from the source should be queryable to all
      2. Admins / Permissioned users can see the full path by combining
         this with the source path
      3. The media API should accept files based on the Song ID
2: Parse and add metadata to tables
    (inherant metadata: title, year, track #, disk #)
3: Create tables & resolvers for computed properties
    (albums, artists, composers, labels, genres, )
4: Create REST API to serve audio and artwork
5: Use frontend to create first working prototype!
6: Make API able to transcode
7: Ensure song and artwork are actually what they say they are
